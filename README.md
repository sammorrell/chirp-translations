# Translations for Chirp
This repository contains the translations, contained in strings files, for the Chirp iOS, Android and Web apps. Chirp is an app that allows you to keep track of the latest collisions of black holes, neutron stars and maybe more, just minutes after they are detected by the growing international gravitational wave detector network.

**More info and web app**: http://chirp.sr.bham.ac.uk/

These files represent an ongoing effort to improve the accessibility of the app by offering it in the native languages of as many of our users as possible. Our aim is to initially translate Chirp into the following languages:
- **English** (en-GB / en-US)
- **Japanese** (ja-JP)
- **Italian** (it-IT)
- **Hindi** (hi-IN)
- **Dutch** (nl-NL)

## Contributing
Do you know one of the languages we want to support? Would you like to add a different language to the app?

We would be very grateful for any translations you would like to contribute to the app. We are currently working out the details for user contributed translations of Chirp. We will update this readme with details when we have a solution in place.
