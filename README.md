# Translations for Chirp
<a href="https://gitlocalize.com/repo/6185/whole_project?utm_source=badge"> <img src="https://gitlocalize.com/repo/6185/whole_project/badge.svg" /> </a>

This repository contains the translations, contained in strings files, for the Chirp iOS, Android and Web apps. Chirp is an app that allows you to keep track of the latest collisions of black holes, neutron stars and maybe more, just minutes after they are detected by the growing international gravitational wave detector network.

**More info and web app**: http://chirp.sr.bham.ac.uk/

These files represent an ongoing effort to improve the accessibility of the app by offering it in the native languages of as many of our users as possible. Our aim is to initially translate Chirp into the following languages:
- **English** (en)
- **German** (de)
- **Spanish** (es)
- **French** (fr)
- **Japanese** (ja-JP)
- **Italian** (it)
- **Hindi** (hi)
- **Dutch** (nl)
- **Russian** (ru)

If you spot any errors in translation, would like to apply to moderate a language, or request another language, please contact Dr Sam Cooper via email on **sam dot cooper** [at] ligo dot org. 

## Contributing
Do you know one of the languages we want to support? Would you like to add a different language to the app?

The development team, and the worldwide community of Chirp users, would be very grateful for any translations you would like to contribute to the app. Our community-driven translation effort is being hosted at GitLocalize. To contribute, you only require a GitHub account.
